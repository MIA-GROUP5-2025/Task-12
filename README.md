# Task-12.2 | ROBOCON

## Requirements
  * Movement Motors
  * Dribbling Motors
  * Shooting and Passing Motors

## Steps

 1. **we have to first study our robot weight and constraints so we can choose the right motors for the weight and voltage limit**
 2. **after knowing the robots maximum weight and battery voltages which are : (25kg and 24v) we now have to decide how we will operate our moving mechanism with the right motor** 
 3. **as for the moving motor we decided that for a basketball game the robot must be reacting swiftly so we chose brushless DC motor with good rpm and torque to be able to move the whole body**
 4. **for the dribbling it should be precise movement without extra inertia and torque that can handle the robot arm and basketball weight for 1m height  so we went to choose Servo motors for such function**
 5. **for shooting and passing we need also good torque and higher rpm to shoot fast with high momentum to acheive hieghts and distances**

## searching
 1. **we went through process of calculating the needed weights to move the body with right motors for the robot to behave well**
 2. **searched for the basketball weight**
 3. **tried to calculate a reasonable arm for the robot**
